## Women in Germany (Lindsay Wilson)

Hitler is quoted in a 1935 Frauenshaft Party Day speech telling the audience that Childbearing “is her greatest honor” for all good Ayran women. Germany had several competing ideals regarding the role of women in German society during World War II. For some,  women were seen as the “Mother of the Country. This mainly occurred during the early years of the World War. It was called Volksgeminshaft based on the idea that societal roles and responsibilities are primarily decided by gender. Volksgeminshaft is the idea that  “Man’s world was the state, woman’s the home, and the two worlds complemented each other; women ought not to attempt to penetrate the world of men.” (Leila Rupp) [^1]. However, this idea was shaken during World War II. For some, women were seen as the answer to the employment problem in the workforce. During World War II, men were away fighting, and women needed to step up and take places in the factories and the workplace. This was against many German ideals but was necessary and could not be avoided. Single women were encouraged to work in factories. The general idea was that women should work if they can’t get married. Marrying was the number one goal, and working was what single women should do for their country until they succeeded. Many Germans believed that “ The only legitimate role was the mother or one of its derivatives in the “social motherhood” (social worker, teacher, nurse, etc.).”[^2]. (Jonathon Moch) Less desirable mothers were more often pushed towards the factories. This view was explicitly towards desirable mothers who could help create the Aryan race. Jewish, Gypsy, and other undesirable mothers were heavily encouraged not to give birth. This over-emphasis on women for child rearing was especially prevalent in Germany due to the decreasing birth rate. The Birthrate had decreased by 14.7 percent by 1933.[^3]. (Population Index) This increased the national focus on policy regarding women and was part of the reason Nazis were voted into power. The government increased different kinds of propaganda for women, such as this poster that showed women protecting their many kids from the war. Having many children was meant to be seen as patriotic. Talcott Parsons [^4]. expressed that German women were generally more submissive to their men than women in Britain or the United States. The societal pressure to defer and be a good housewife was much stronger than in countries with similar values. Some brave women joined the fight for causes they believed in. The Nazis had female test pilots named Hanna Reitsh and Melitta von Straffburg. These women fought the societal ideals to fight for the Nazi military. Many more women in Germany became involved in the resistance. One example is Sophie Scroll, who was executed for treason at age 21 after being caught handing out anti-Nazi propaganda. Women were influential in saving many lives and were often underestimated in a way that benefited them in espionage and sabotage.

## Women’s Role in Japan (Lindsay Wilson)
Women in Japan were viewed very differently than Women in Europe during the war. The mothers were seen as "protectors of their Women in Japan " in a very different way than Women in Europe during the war. The mothers were seen as "protectors of their houses." While the men were away fighting women were told to defend their homes. This is different from places like Germany where women were told to focus on having kids as what they could do for the war.  Women were often seen in factories and the workplace in Japan. This improved living standards for women overall. The increased living standards for women were continued even after Japan lost the war. The occupation forces, particularly the United States, regarded Japanese women's suffrage and women's visibility in the national election as a barometer with which to measure the overall improvement of life under occupation houses.[^5].

The occupation forces, particularly the United States, regarded Japanese women's suffrage and women's visibility in the national election as a barometer with which to measure the overall improvement of life under occupation. Women were influential in the Japanese War Effort. They were often in factories working on planes and other important instruments of War. For example, in Okinawa, many women were mobilized for nursing and resistance work. However, many women were treated harshly under Japanese occupation. This is especially the case with people who were used as "comfort women" for the occupying Japanese soldiers. ” It is estimated that 80,000 to 200,000 Korean women were used as sex slaves during World War II. Women across Asia were being systematically raped by Japanese soldiers for "morale". [^6]. This was a war crime that had not been largely studied until recently. Comfort Women shows one example of the harshness of lives for many women who lived under Japanese occupation. This is an ongoing topic being researched in Korea today that has opened up a whole new side of studies about women during the second world war. Many women were influential in the Japanese War Effort.  Overall there were both positive and negative outcomes from the new treatment of women during World War Two. This began a new era of treatment for women in the workplace, although there were still a lot of issues with the inequality and harsh treatment of foreigners during World War Two.


## Women’s Roles in the UK (Karlie Keidel)
Because of the traditional gender roles of women in the United Kingdom that existed long before the Second World War began, women were expected to fill the roles typically held by men in society while simultaneously fulfilling their roles as caretakers and homemakers. Despite the challenges this posed for women, who were now supposed to assume two or more full-time positions, many rose to the cause. They held roles in the military, industry, agriculture, and other essential parts of society that men previously filled. Groups like the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), Land Girls, Canary Girls, the Women’s Timber Corps, and many others contributed to the allies’ success. Without them, their nation would not have been able to function as it once had.[^7].
When discussing the role women in the UK played in WW2, it is crucial to highlight their involvement in the military. In December of 1941, conscription service began for women, making it mandatory for women to serve in military positions. There were three groups they could choose to join: the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), or the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS).[^8]. The WAAF was formed in 1939 to allow more men to be on the Royal Air Force (RAF) frontlines. Women in the WAAF served in several roles, including performing maintenance on aircraft, acting as meteorologists by creating weather reports, and working with code to contribute to intelligence operations. The WRNS, unique to the other two groups, was previously established in World War I and reestablished in 1939 for service in the Second World War. [^9].To free up positions held by men so they could serve on the frontlines, women took on shoreline responsibilities that included planning naval operations, interpreting code, repairing machinery, etc. The ATS was initially created in 1938, with jobs for women being limited to cooks, drivers, and other roles that did not involve combat.[^10]. By the war’s end, the ATS became the branch with the most female members, as over 250,000 women served. 
Beyond their military roles, women served in agricultural and industrial positions of equal importance, which allowed the UK to have as usual of a society as possible during the war. Women worked in munitions factories, creating ammo and firearms for those serving on the frontlines, which proved to be long and strenuous work. Certain groups of munitions producers were more dangerous to work in than others. Some women dealt with toxic chemicals for long periods, earning them the nickname “Canary Girls,” as the sulfur they handled turned their skin and hair yellow. Other labor-intensive jobs, such as the Women’s Timber Corps and the Women’s Land Army, were critical in maintaining the function of British society. The Women’s Land Army, consisting of women from rural and suburban areas, ensured the nation did not starve. The Women’s Timber Corps, also known as “Lumber Girls,” was responsible for cutting down trees, loading trucks, and delivering timber around the UK. Without women of all ages throughout the nation contributing to the war effort, the war’s outcome could have been entirely different, showcasing the necessity for women to participate in society just as much as men had.

## Women’s Roles in the Soviet Union (Karlie Keidel)
More so than any other allied nation, women were extremely active in military combat in the Soviet Union. Like the United Kingdom, women in the USSR were expected to fill workforce roles at home in fields like agriculture and munitions production. While most women in the USSR took on civilian roles left behind by men, a substantial portion of them served in the Red Army, most of which fulfilled medical roles. 
Of the allied nations, the Soviet Union was the only one where women participated in active combat. Arguably one of the most documented areas of female participation in the Red Army, sniper positions were the most popular amongst women in combat roles. Through the Central Women’s School of Sniper Training, women learned how to use (you guessed it) snipers.[^11]. These women, along with women who were considered self-trained, were sent to the frontlines in pairs; one to spot and one to shoot. While many women served as nurses to the Red Army, female medics were considered soldiers and as such were expected to participate in combat if they were not actively helping the wounded. Even under fire, these women gave medical attention to those who needed it. They are considered one of the most vital roles in the Red Army. Women fulfilled multiple roles in the air, including navigators, mechanics, and pilots. One group, the 588th Night Bomber regiment, more popularly known as the Night Witches, is among the most successful and notorious of all female groups that fought in the Soviet Military. Before they dropped bombs, they would idle their engines, making their attacks completely silent as they stealthily flew. From manning tanks to performing maintenance on them, women operated on teams that used tanks. Being able to operate and maintain a tank was a valuable skill to have, and many women rose to the occasion to fill these positions.[^12].
Housing machine guns and destroying enemy fortifications were key responsibilities for women in these roles. Because tanks themselves are weapons, women manning them would have also been on the frontlines. Overall, women were influential in the military of the Soviet Union in a way that was unique from every other country that participated in the war.

## Women’s Role in Switzerland (Ethan)
   
Even though countries such as Switzerland were considered neutral countries during the Second World War, their role in the conflict was still quite noteworthy. When thinking of an armed military conflict, particularly World War II, when people think of individual contributions to the war, they often think of the men who went off to war. However, the role that women played on the home front and at war usually is understated. This is true not only in countries directly in conflict but also in neutral ones. For instance, in Switzerland, women were very crucial in supporting the war effort. In 1939, The Swiss Women’s Auxiliary Military Service was founded. Through this service, women played a vital role in supporting the war effort. .[^13]. Not only did women here in Switzerland still have to work in their traditional roles in the home such as being a mother to their children and cooking for them, but they also now had to participate in the service as well. Through this service, they were in roles such as medical staff, communication members, and logistical positions as well. While some of these roles had seen women in those positions before, the roles that women had to play were greatly increased as men were now being moved to combat-oriented positions. This within Switzerland created a vacuum for women to move up within society. As men were moved out of roles women were then moved into those roles to fill the demand. Therefore more women began to move up the ladder in society and perform roles that had previously only been allocated to men. For instance, in areas such as medicine, women were now more directly involved with patient care rather than more supplementary roles. In spite of these changes and more direct roles in society women’s rights were still playing catch up. Women still did not have the right to vote in Switzerland for many years after the Second World War ended. Women in Switzerland had to work in their traditional roles in the home, but could break gender roles and fight for their country as well even if their country was not necessarily directly in the war. Through this service, women played a vital role in supporting the war effort as well as a vital role in the new suffrage movement that would sweep through Europe after the war's end.


## Women’s Role in Sweden (Ethan)
At first, Sweden was also very traditional in regard to expectations of women. However, there were some specific outlets in which women could serve outside of their normal expected positions. For example, the Swedish women had the Swedish Women’s Voluntary Defense Force. While this force is clearly not obligatory hence the name. They still provided a vital role to the society and security services of the nation.[^14]. Much like the women in the Swiss auxiliary force women here in the Swedish one played very similar roles in medical and communications positions. This again shifted gender roles as women were now becoming more the heads of the households as well as holding down important positions in the workforce as men were away. In these neutral countries, while war was felt as directly at home, in terms of gender roles the impact was still quite strong. Men were shifted away from household life while women had to work and run the day-to-day, looking after children and managing stressful jobs as well. Sadly in spite of the advances that women made in society through these shifting circumstances, women’s rights still were very slow to come to fruition in these regions.​ This force became a staple of the country which allowed women to make a difference and protect their country in a society where that was usually frowned upon.
